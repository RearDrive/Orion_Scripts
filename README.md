**# Orion Client Scripts**
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of custom automation scripts developed for the **Orion Client**, an enhanced client for the classic MMORPG *Ultima Online*. 

While *Ultima Online* is a legacy title, its architecture relies heavily on complex internal simulation and state management (similar to MUDs). This makes it an excellent environment for developing logic-based scripts that monitor real-time data streams and trigger automated responses.

This is a collection of scripts I tweaked, programed and updated.

**Key functionalities include:**
* **Real-time Event Monitoring:** Scripts that listen for specific game states (e.g., health status, inventory changes, enemy proximity).
* **Automated Decision Logic:** Algorithms that execute specific actions based on incoming data from the game client.
* **System Optimization:** Refactoring and updating legacy scripts to improve execution speed and reliability.

## Project Scope
The goal of this project was to optimize gameplay efficiency by programmatically handling repetitive tasks and reacting to game events faster than manual input allows.

## Technical Context
These scripts utilize the API provided by the Orion Client to interact with the game engine.
* **Platform:** Ultima Online (Orion Client)
* **Focus:** Automation, State Detection, and Script Logic

## Credits
* **Author: Yofun - Script development, optimization, and logic implementation.
* **API Developer:** Great thanks to **@Hotride**, the original developer of the Orion Assistant API, which makes this automation possible.
